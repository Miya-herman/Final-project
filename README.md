# Monitoring Inclusive Neighborhood Development : Abstract

This project aims to address the question of how the Baltimore City DHCD can measure the progress of housing and development initiatives. Baltimore has a long history of inequitable development along racial and income lines, which has contributed to high rates of poverty and social injustices in certain neighborhoods. In order to address this issue, the DHCD has put forward a framework based on 3 key strategies: expanding resources and capacity for community development, promoting access and equity, and investing in all neighborhoods.  
Using this framework to guide our research, we have found several key methodologies that could be implemented to model and track inclusive development progress in Baltimore City neighborhoods.
